The primary advantage of this Pedersen hash function is its efficiency.
The ability to compute the hash efficiently makes it an attractive
proposal for use within the circuits associated with zk-SNARK proofs
:raw-latex:`\cite{efficiency}`. Having a standard, secure, and efficient
hash function is one of the paramount aspect for implementing usable,
comprehensible, and easily verifiable zero knowledge proofs.
