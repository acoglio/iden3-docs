The search for this elliptic curve defined is motivated by its
usefulness in zk-SNARK proofs. Moreover the ability to find it in a
deterministic way—so that it was clear no other considerations were
taken for defining—is paramount as it significantly reduces the
possibility of a backdoor being present, thus leading to better
security.
