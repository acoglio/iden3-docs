| A Merkle audit path for a leaf in a Merkle tree is the shortest list
  of additional nodes in the tree required to compute the root hash for
  that tree.
| If the root computed from the audit path matches the true root, then
  the audit path is a proof of membership for that leaf in the tree.
  [SAY THAT ALSO THE NONCE AND SO ON].
| Talk about proof of non-membership - two types: if empty or another
  node.
