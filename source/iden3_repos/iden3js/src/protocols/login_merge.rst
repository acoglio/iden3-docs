Login protocol
==============

The login protocol is based on the signature protocol, in which a user
signs a packet using an authorized kSign key.

For the login case, the user desires to assert a particular identity (an
ethereum address in this case) to a server so that they are allowed
access into the service while being identified.

Assumptions
-----------

-  Secure connection between Wallet and Server.
-  Secure connection between Web Client and Server.
-  Wallet authenticates the Server in the connection.
-  Web Client authenticates the Server in the connection.

What is needed
--------------

-  Server authenticates the Ethereum Address and Ethereum Name from the
   Wallet.
-  The user transfers the authentication from the Wallet to the Web
   Client.

Protocol flow
-------------

|image1|

Challenges contain a cryptographic nonce and have a timeout that
indicates the validity of the nonce in the challenge. A signed challenge
with a timed out nonce must be rejected by the server. The server must
store a list of not timed out nonces that haven’t been signed yet to
guarantee freshness.

A cryptographic nonce must be securely generated and long enough to
avoid colisions (we use 256 bits).

Signature Protocol v0.1 spec
----------------------------

A signature may be requested as follows:

::

   {
     header: {
       typ: iden3.sig.v0_1
     }
     body: {
       type: TYPE
       data: DATA
     }
   }

The user will generate a packet following the signature protocol
specification, that may contain data from a signature request, or may be
made from scratch. The packet contains a header and a payload, and is
serialized and signed following the `JWS
standard <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515>`__. Usually the ``form``
will be filled by the user, and ``data`` will be copied from a request.

The structure of the ``data`` and ``form`` in the payload are specified
by the ``type`` (what is being signed) in the payload. The rest of the
elements are specified by the ``typ`` (signature packet) in the header.

::

   JWS_PAYLOAD = {
     type: TYPE
     data: DATA
     form: FORM
     ksign: str # ksing public key in compressed form
     proofKSing: proofClaim # Proof of authorize k sign claim (which contains the public key in compressed form)
   }

   JWS_HEADER = {
     typ: iden3.sig.v0_1
     iss: str # Ethereum Address
     iat: uint # issued at time, unix timestamp
     exp: uint # expiration time, unix timestamp
     alg: ? # algorithm
   }

   JWS_SIGN(JWS_HEADER, JWS_PAYLOAD)

Each Signature request ``type`` has a view representation for the user,
where the ``data`` and ``form`` are presented. Some of the values may be
hidden from the user when necessary, but only if doing so doesn’t
compromise the security of the user. In the request view, the user has
the ability to pick some elements of the ``form``.

``ksign`` is the compressed public key of a secp256k ECDSA key pair. The
``proofKSing`` contains a KSign Authorize Claim for a secp256k public
key.

As ``JWS_HEADER.alg`` we will use a custom algorithm (not defined in the
JWS standard): “EK256K1”, which is ECDSA with secp256k1 curve and keccak
as hash function, the same signature algorithm configuration used in
Ethereum.

Auxiliary data structures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   proofClaim: {
       signature: signature # Relay root + date signed by relay
       date: uint
       leaf: claim
       proofs: proofClaimPartial[]
   }

   proofClaimPartial: {
       mtp0: mtp # merkle tree proof of leaf existence
       mtp1: mtp # merkle tree proof of leaf non-existence
       root: key # merkle tree root
       aux: nil | { ver: uint, era: uint, idAddr: str } # Necessary data to construct SetRootClaim from root
   }

Usually the relay returns the ``proofClaim`` data structure to prove
that a claim is valid and is in the merkle tree.

Identity Assertion v0.1 spec
----------------------------

payload:

::

   type: iden3.iden_assert.v0_1
   data: {
     challenge: nonce # 256 bits in base64
     timeout: uint # seconds
     origin: str # domain
   }
   form: {
     ethName: str # ethereumName
     proofAssignName: proofClaim # proof of claim Assign Name for ethName
   }

A session id, if necessary, can be computed from the challenge. This
session id can be used to link the communication between the web service
and the wallet service.

view:

::

   type: Identity Assertion
   data: {
     origin: str # domain
   }
   form: {
     ethName: str # ethereum name
   }

Algorithms
----------

Here we show an overview of the algorithms steps used for verification
of the proofs and signatures used in the login protocol. The following
algorithms consider the case in which there is a only a single trusted
entity (identified by ``relayPk``) that acts as a relay and as a domain
name server.

Signature verification algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   VerifySignedPacket(jwsHeader, jwsPayload, signature, relayPk):
   1. Verify jwsHeader.typ is 'iden3.sig.v0_1'
   2. Verify jwsHeader.alg is 'EK256K1'
   3. Verify that jwsHeader.iat <= now() < jwsHeader.exp 
   4. Verify that jwsPayload.ksign is in jwsPayload.proofKSign.leaf
   5. Verify that jwsHeader.iss is in jwsPayload.proofKSign
   6. Verify that signature of JWS(jwsHeader, jwsPayload) by jwsPayload.ksign is signature
   7. VerifyProofOfClaim(jwsPayload.proofKSign, relayPk)

In 4. we verify that the ksign used to sign the packet is authorized by
the user, identified by jwsHeader.iss ethereum address.

Iden Assert verification algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   VerifyIdenAssertV01(nonceDB, origin, jwsHeader, jwsPayload, signature, relayPk):
   1. Verify jwsPayload.type is 'iden3.iden_assert.v0_1'
   2. Verify jwsPayload.data.origin is origin
   3. Verify jwsPayload.data.challenge is in nonceDB and hasn't expired, delete it
   4. Verify that jwsHeader.iss and jwsPayload.form.ethName are in jwsPayload.proofAssignName.leaf
   5. VerifyProofOfClaim(jwsPayload.form.ethName, relayPk)

ProofOfClaim verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   VerifyProofOfClaim(p, relayPk):
   1. Verify signature of p.proofs[-1].root by relayPk is p.signature
      let leaf = p.leaf
   2. loop for each proof in p.proofs:
       2.1 Verify proof.mtp0 is existence proof
       2.2 Verify proof.mtp0 with leaf and proof.root
       2.3 Verify proof.mtp1 is non-existence proof
       2.4 Verify proof.mtp1 with ClaimIncrementVersion(leaf) and proof.root
           leaf = NewClaimSetRootClaim(p.root, p.aux.ver, p.aux.era, p.aux.ethAddr)

Read the login protocol specification `here <login_spec.md>`__.

Define new NonceDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: js

   const nonceDB = new iden3.protocols.NonceDB();

Generate New Request of Identity Assert
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  input

   -  ``nonceDB``: NonceDB class object
   -  ``origin``: domain of the emitter of the request
   -  ``timeout``: unixtime format, valid until that date. We can use
      for example 2 minutes (``2*60`` seconds)

-  output

   -  ``signatureRequest``: ``Object``

   .. code:: js

      const signatureRequest = iden3.protocols.login.newRequestIdenAssert(nonceDB, origin, 2*60);

The ``nonce`` of the ``signatureRequest`` can be getted from:

.. code:: js

   const nonce = signatureRequest.body.data.challenge;
   // nonce is the string containing the nonce value

We can add auxiliar data to the ``nonce`` in the ``nonceDB`` only one
time:

.. code:: js

   const added = nodeDB.addAuxToNonce(nonce, auxdata);
   // added is a bool confirming if the aux data had been added

Sign Packet
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  input

   -  ``signatureRequest``: object generated in the
      ``newRequestIdenAssert`` function
   -  ``userAddr``: Eth Address of the user that signs the data packet
   -  ``ethName``: name assigned to the ``userAddr``
   -  ``proofOfEthName``: ``proofOfClaim`` of the ``ethName``
   -  ``kc``: iden3.KeyContainer object
   -  ``ksign``: KOperational authorized for the ``userAddr``
   -  ``proofOfKSign``: ``proofOfClaim`` of the ``ksign``
   -  ``expirationTime``: unixtime format, signature will be valid until
      that date

-  output

   -  ``signedPacket``: ``String``

   .. code:: js

      const expirationTime = unixtime + (3600 * 60);
      const signedPacket = iden3.protocols.login.signIdenAssertV01(signatureRequest, usrAddr, ethName, proofOfEthName, kc, ksign, proofOfKSign, expirationTime);

Verify Signed Packet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  input

   -  ``nonceDB``: NonceDB class object
   -  ``origin``: domain of the emitter of the request
   -  ``signedPacket``: object generated in the ``signIdenAssertV01``
      function

-  output

   -  ``nonce``: nonce object of the signedPacket, that has been just
      deleted from the nonceDB when the signedPacket is verified. If the
      verification fails, the nonce will be ``undefined``

   .. code:: js

      const verified = iden3.protocols.login.verifySignedPacket(nonceDB, origin, signedPacket);

See the `login specification document <login_spec.md>`__ for information
about the protocol design.

Rationale
=========

The following document contains references to similar protocols on which
our login protocol relies on or takes inspiration from.

Signature format
----------------

Use JSON to encode the object that will be signed.

JSON Signing formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

https://medium.facilelogin.com/json-message-signing-alternatives-897f90d411c

-  JSON Web Signature (JWS)

   -  Doesn’t need canonicalization
   -  Allows signing arbitrary data (not only JSON)
   -  Widely used

-  JSON Cleartext Signature (JCS)
-  Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) Object Signing

https://matrix.org/docs/spec/appendices.html#signing-json

-  Matrix JSON Signing

   -  Allows having multiple signatures with different protocols for a
      single JSON

The FIDO protocols security goals:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[SG-1]
^^^^^^

Strong User Authentication: Authenticate (i.e. recognize) a user and/or
a device to a relying party with high (cryptographic) strength. ####
[SG-2] Credential Guessing Resilience: Provide robust protection against
eavesdroppers, e.g. be resilient to physical observation, resilient to
targeted impersonation, resilient to throttled and unthrottled guessing.
#### [SG-3] Credential Disclosure Resilience: Be resilient to phishing
attacks and real-time phishing attack, including resilience to online
attacks by adversaries able to actively manipulate network traffic. ####
[SG-4] Unlinkablity: Protect the protocol conversation such that any two
relying parties cannot link the conversation to one user (i.e. be
unlinkable). #### [SG-5] Verifier Leak Resilience: Be resilient to leaks
from other relying parties. I.e., nothing that a verifier could possibly
leak can help an attacker impersonate the user to another relying party.
#### [SG-6] Authenticator Leak Resilience: Be resilient to leaks from
other FIDO Authenticators. I.e., nothing that a particular FIDO
Authenticator could possibly leak can help an attacker to impersonate
any other user to any relying party. #### [SG-7] User Consent: Notify
the user before a relationship to a new relying party is being
established (requiring explicit consent). #### [SG-8] Limited PII: Limit
the amount of personal identifiable information (PII) exposed to the
relying party to the absolute minimum. #### [SG-9] Attestable
Properties: Relying Party must be able to verify FIDO Authenticator
model/type (in order to calculate the associated risk). #### [SG-10] DoS
Resistance: Be resilient to Denial of Service Attacks. I.e. prevent
attackers from inserting invalid registration information for a
legitimate user for the next login phase. Afterward, the legitimate user
will not be able to login successfully anymore. #### [SG-11] Forgery
Resistance: Be resilient to Forgery Attacks (Impersonation Attacks).
I.e. prevent attackers from attempting to modify intercepted
communications in order to masquerade as the legitimate user and login
to the system. #### [SG-12] Parallel Session Resistance: Be resilient to
Parallel Session Attacks. Without knowing a user’s authentication
credential, an attacker can masquerade as the legitimate user by
creating a valid authentication message out of some eavesdropped
communication between the user and the server. #### [SG-13] Forwarding
Resistance: Be resilient to Forwarding and Replay Attacks. Having
intercepted previous communications, an attacker can impersonate the
legal user to authenticate to the system. The attacker can replay or
forward the intercepted messages. #### [SG-14] (not covered by U2F)
Transaction Non-Repudiation: Provide strong cryptographic
non-repudiation for secure transactions. #### [SG-15] Respect for
Operating Environment Security Boundaries: Ensure that registrations and
private key material as a shared system resource is appropriately
protected according to the operating environment privilege boundaries in
place on the FIDO user device. #### [SG-16] Assessable Level of
Security: Ensure that the design and implementation of the Authenticator
allows for the testing laboratory / FIDO Alliance to assess the level of
security provided by the Authenticator.
