Rationale
=========

The following document contains references to similar protocols on which
our login protocol relies on or takes inspiration from.

Signature format
----------------

Use JSON to encode the object that will be signed.

JSON Signing formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

https://medium.facilelogin.com/json-message-signing-alternatives-897f90d411c

-  JSON Web Signature (JWS)

   -  Doesn't need canonicalization
   -  Allows signing arbitrary data (not only JSON)
   -  Widely used

-  JSON Cleartext Signature (JCS)
-  Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) Object Signing

https://matrix.org/docs/spec/appendices.html#signing-json

-  Matrix JSON Signing

   -  Allows having multiple signatures with different protocols for a
      single JSON

Possible attacks
----------------

The FIDO protocols security goals:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[SG-1]
^^^^^^

Strong User Authentication: Authenticate (i.e. recognize) a user and/or
a device to a relying party with high (cryptographic) strength. ####
[SG-2] Credential Guessing Resilience: Provide robust protection against
eavesdroppers, e.g. be resilient to physical observation, resilient to
targeted impersonation, resilient to throttled and unthrottled guessing.
#### [SG-3] Credential Disclosure Resilience: Be resilient to phishing
attacks and real-time phishing attack, including resilience to online
attacks by adversaries able to actively manipulate network traffic. ####
[SG-4] Unlinkablity: Protect the protocol conversation such that any two
relying parties cannot link the conversation to one user (i.e. be
unlinkable). #### [SG-5] Verifier Leak Resilience: Be resilient to leaks
from other relying parties. I.e., nothing that a verifier could possibly
leak can help an attacker impersonate the user to another relying party.
#### [SG-6] Authenticator Leak Resilience: Be resilient to leaks from
other FIDO Authenticators. I.e., nothing that a particular FIDO
Authenticator could possibly leak can help an attacker to impersonate
any other user to any relying party. #### [SG-7] User Consent: Notify
the user before a relationship to a new relying party is being
established (requiring explicit consent). #### [SG-8] Limited PII: Limit
the amount of personal identifiable information (PII) exposed to the
relying party to the absolute minimum. #### [SG-9] Attestable
Properties: Relying Party must be able to verify FIDO Authenticator
model/type (in order to calculate the associated risk). #### [SG-10] DoS
Resistance: Be resilient to Denial of Service Attacks. I.e. prevent
attackers from inserting invalid registration information for a
legitimate user for the next login phase. Afterward, the legitimate user
will not be able to login successfully anymore. #### [SG-11] Forgery
Resistance: Be resilient to Forgery Attacks (Impersonation Attacks).
I.e. prevent attackers from attempting to modify intercepted
communications in order to masquerade as the legitimate user and login
to the system. #### [SG-12] Parallel Session Resistance: Be resilient to
Parallel Session Attacks. Without knowing a userâ€™s authentication
credential, an attacker can masquerade as the legitimate user by
creating a valid authentication message out of some eavesdropped
communication between the user and the server. #### [SG-13] Forwarding
Resistance: Be resilient to Forwarding and Replay Attacks. Having
intercepted previous communications, an attacker can impersonate the
legal user to authenticate to the system. The attacker can replay or
forward the intercepted messages. #### [SG-14] (not covered by U2F)
Transaction Non-Repudiation: Provide strong cryptographic
non-repudiation for secure transactions. #### [SG-15] Respect for
Operating Environment Security Boundaries: Ensure that registrations and
private key material as a shared system resource is appropriately
protected according to the operating environment privilege boundaries in
place on the FIDO user device. #### [SG-16] Assessable Level of
Security: Ensure that the design and implementation of the Authenticator
allows for the testing laboratory / FIDO Alliance to assess the level of
security provided by the Authenticator.
