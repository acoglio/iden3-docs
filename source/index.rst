Iden3 Documentation Site
========================


Iden3 is an open source project offering a complete decentralized identity management solution over the public blockchain. It is designed with four fundamental goals in mind:

**Enable Self Sovereign Identities**, whereby identities are created, owned and controlled by the user.

**Accesibility**, by promoting the development of open standards and ease of use.

**Scalability**, by minimizing the number of accesses to the blockchain that identity management and claim processing requires.   

**Privacy by design** by using including zkSNARKs to prove claims whithout revealing any information other than the validity of the claim.

          you don't understand something, or cannot find what you are looking for, or have any
