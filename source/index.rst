Iden3 Documentation Site
========================


Iden3 is an open source project offering a complete decentralized identity management solution over the public blockchain designed with four fundamental goals:

**Enable Self Sovereign Identities**, whereby identities are created, owned and controlled by the user.

**Accesibility**, by promoting the development of open standards and ease of use.

**Scalability**, by minimizing the number of accesses to the blockchain that identity management and claim processing requires.   

**Privacy by design** by using including zkSNARKs to prove claims whithout revealing any information other than the validity of the claim.

.. note:: Our team can always use your feedback and help to improve the tutorials and material included. If
          you don't understand something, or cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, help us make
          the documentation better by letting us know!

          Submit an issue or pull request on the `GitHub repository
          <https://github.com/iden3/iden3-docs/issues>`_

This documentation site includes a section :ref:`developers` with information on how to solve a specific problem by integrating iden3's software into their own application. There is another section, :ref:`repositories`, which centralizes documentation scattered across different repos in a single place.  Section :ref:`white_papers` provides (will provide...) a descriotion of Iden3's technology.

During the comming months, we will be sorting, improving and extending the documentation, so don't forget to come back. Thank you!!!
