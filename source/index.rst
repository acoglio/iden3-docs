Iden3 Documentation Site
========================


Iden3 is an open source project offering a complete decentralized identity management solution over the public blockchain. It is designed with four fundamental goals in mind:

**Enable Self Sovereign Identities**, whereby identities are created, owned and controlled by the user.

**Accesibility**, by promoting the development of open standards and ease of use.

**Scalability**, by minimizing the number of accesses to the blockchain that identity management and claim processing requires.   

**Privacy by design** by using including zkSNARKs to prove claims whithout revealing any information other than the validity of the claim.

.. note:: Our team can always use your feedback and help to improve the tutorials and material included. If
          you don't understand something, or cannot find what you are looking for, or have any 
          suggestion, help us make the documentation better by letting us know!

          Submit an issue or pull request on the `GitHub repository
          <https://github.com/iden3/iden3-docs/issues>`_

This documentation site includes the fillowing sections:

* :ref:`developers` : guide on how to integrate iden3's software for specific applications.

* :ref:`repositories` centralizes documentation scattered across different iden3's repos in a single place. 

* :ref:`white_papers` provides (will provide...) a description of iden3's technology.

During the comming months, we will be sorting, improving and extending the documentation, so don't forget to come back. Thank you!!!
